Please organize the current directory according to these categories:

Remember to:
- Preserve application packages (don't split up related files)
- Maintain folder structures for applications
- Identify files by extension and content
- Consider timestamp information

Also apply our 7/30 day archiving policy:
- Flag files older than 7 days for review, with special attention to:
  - Financial documents (retain longer)
  - Personal documents (retain longer)
  - Installation files (can often be archived sooner)
- Identify files older than 30 days for potential archiving, but use judgment:
  - Documents that appear important should be preserved
  - Large media files are good candidates for archiving
  - Downloads that appear temporary can be suggested for deletion

Explain your archiving recommendations with clear rationale.
