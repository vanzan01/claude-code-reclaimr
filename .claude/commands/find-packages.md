Please identify application packages and related file groups in the current directory.

Look for:
- Extracted application archives
- Software installations
- File collections that should remain together
- Development project folders

For each package found, provide:
- Package name
- Main purpose
- Component files
- Whether it appears complete or missing components
- Suggested category for organization

Ensure these related files stay together during any organization process.
