Please recall what you've learned about my file organization preferences from previous sessions.

Include:
- Category adjustments I've requested
- File types I typically keep longer
- Patterns in what I archive vs. delete
- Custom categorization rules we've established
- Any corrections I've made to your suggestions

This will help ensure your organization approach continues to improve and align with my preferences.
