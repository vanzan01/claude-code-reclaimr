Please analyze files in the current directory and recommend archiving actions based on our 7/30 day policy.

Apply these rules with human judgment:
1. Files older than 7 days: Flag for review
2. Files older than 30 days: Recommend for archiving or deletion

For each file, make intelligent decisions based on:
- File type and content (financial documents should be retained longer)
- Usage patterns (frequently accessed files should be kept active)
- File importance (critical documents should not be archived)
- File relationships (related files should be archived together)

Please organize your recommendations in these categories:
1. **Review Now**: Files 7-30 days old requiring attention
2. **Archive Candidates**: Files >30 days old that can be safely archived
3. **Delete Candidates**: Files >30 days old that appear safe to delete
4. **Keep Active**: Files that should remain accessible regardless of age

Follow the recommended archive structure:

```
Archives/
├── 7-Day/
│   ├── Documents/
│   ├── Executables/
│   ├── Code/
│   ├── Images/
│   └── ZipFiles/
├── 30-Day/
│   ├── Documents/
│   ├── Executables/
│   ├── Code/
│   ├── Images/
│   └── ZipFiles/
└── Important/
    ├── Financial/
    └── Reference/
```

Remember to maintain category organization within each archive tier. This maintains file type grouping while adding time-based organization, making retrieval more intuitive.

For each file, explain your reasoning so I can understand why you've made each recommendation.

Wait for my approval before performing any archiving actions.
