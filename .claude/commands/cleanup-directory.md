Please help me clean up the current directory with these steps:

1. Identify and categorize all files
2. Flag old files (7+ days) for review
3. Suggest deletion for very old files (30+ days)
4. Identify duplicate files
5. Find large files taking up significant space
6. Suggest an organized folder structure

Present your findings and recommendations in a clear format so I can take action.
