# Claude as Your File Organization Assistant

## Overview

Rather than a standalone application, this document outlines how I (Claude) will serve as your personal file organization assistant. When prompted, I'll help organize your Downloads folder using consistent categories, maintain application package integrity, and implement archiving best practices.

## How It Works

1. **You summon me**: Ask me to organize your Downloads folder
2. **I analyze files**: I'll examine files based on type, age, and relationships
3. **I categorize**: Sort files into logical categories while keeping related files together
4. **I identify archiving candidates**: Flag older files (7+ days) for review
5. **I recommend deletions**: Suggest files that are 30+ days old for potential deletion
6. **I learn from corrections**: Remember any adjustments you make to my categorizations

## My Classification System

I'll organize files into these primary categories:

1. **Documents**: Office files, PDFs, text files, eBooks
2. **Images**: Photos, screenshots, artwork, graphics
3. **Audio**: Music, podcasts, voice recordings
4. **Video**: Movies, screen recordings, video clips
5. **Archives**: ZIP, RAR, compressed files
6. **Executables**: Software installers, applications
7. **Code**: Source code, development files
8. **Web Content**: HTML, web pages, bookmarks
9. **Financial**: Receipts, statements, financial documents
10. **Personal**: IDs, health records, certificates
11. **Temporary**: Files pending review

## Package Preservation

I'll be careful to keep application packages together:
- Identify folder structures that appear to be applications
- Maintain integrity of unzipped application folders
- Never split up files that belong together
- Categorize entire packages based on their primary purpose

## Time-Based Organization

I'll implement the 7/30 day policy you requested:

- **0-7 days**: Active files in primary category folders
- **7-30 days**: Files flagged for review
- **30+ days**: Candidates for archiving or deletion

## How I'll Learn

As I help you organize files across multiple sessions:

- I'll remember how you correct my categorizations
- I'll note which files you consider important
- I'll learn your preferences for specific file types
- I'll adapt to your archive/deletion preferences

## How to Work With Me

When you want me to organize your files:

1. **Call me to action**: "Claude, please organize my Downloads folder"
2. **Provide specifics**: Let me know if you want to focus on certain file types or actions
3. **Review my suggestions**: I'll identify files for archiving/deletion but won't act without approval
4. **Correct as needed**: If I miscategorize something, let me know so I can learn
5. **Ask for summaries**: I can provide reports on what I've organized

## Sample Prompts

Here are some ways to direct my file organization assistance:

- "Claude, organize my Downloads folder according to our established categories"
- "Claude, identify files in Downloads that are older than 30 days for potential deletion"
- "Claude, look for application packages in Downloads that should be kept together"
- "Claude, categorize my recent downloads but keep program installations intact"

## Benefits of Our Approach

Working with me directly instead of a software tool offers several advantages:

- **No installation needed**: No software to install or configure
- **Complete flexibility**: Easy to adjust rules and preferences as we go
- **Human judgment**: I can make nuanced decisions about ambiguous files
- **Context awareness**: I understand the content and purpose of your files
- **Natural interaction**: Just tell me what you need in plain language
